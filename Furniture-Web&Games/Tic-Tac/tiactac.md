# Introduction  tic tack  toe game :  
Thsi si a simple game of tic tac toe Most of the games I have seen online require two players, and we wanted to try creating a game where one player plays against  another player.

## Play the game here

It works well enough at the moment, but I will like to eventually improve the game in a few ways:

Make the computer (playing as O) smarter. At the moment the computer randomly chooses a square to play, not trying to get a win.
Add a win counter
Allow the human to choose whether to play as X or O
Have the computer make funny remarks with each play/win

   1. the  first section of this game will contain a title.
   2. The second section will display whose turn it is currently. Inside the display we have a span which will contain  X  or O depending on the current user. We'll apply classes to this span to colorize the text.
   3. The third section is the one that holds the board for the game. It has a container class so we can properly place our tiles. Inside this section we have nine div which will act as the tiles inside the board.
   4. The fourth section will be responsible to announce the end game result. By default it is empty and we'll modify its content from java script.
   5.    The last section will hold our controls, which contains a reset button
